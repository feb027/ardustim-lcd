- Supports 60+ different wheel patterns from various manufacturers
- Variable RPM control via potentiometer, fixed RPM, or sweep modes
- Real-time pattern switching and RPM adjustment
- Optional LCD interface for standalone operation
- Serial interface for computer control

## Target Hardware
- Arduino Nano/Uno (ATmega328P)
- Optional 16x2 I2C LCD display
- 5 push buttons for UI control
- Potentiometer for RPM control
- Output pins for trigger signals

## Use Cases
- ECU development and testing
- Automotive diagnostics
